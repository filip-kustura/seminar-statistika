## Project Overview

This project is the result of a group seminar completed during the mandatory **_Statistics_** undergraduate course in the spring of 2021. It investigates the correlation between the average height of a nation's citizens and its success in the **Summer Olympic Games (2016, Rio de Janeiro)** and **Winter Olympic Games (2018, Pyeongchang)**.

The study uses data collection, descriptive statistics, and statistical tests to determine if a higher average citizen height correlates with a nation's success, measured by the number of Olympic medals won.

## Contents

- **Motivation**: Analyzing Croatian sports success despite limited investment and exploring whether height plays a significant role in international achievements.
- **Data Collection**: Collection of country-specific height and Olympic medal data.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Visualizations and calculations for both the Summer and Winter Games, including Pearson correlation coefficients.
- **Statistical Tests**: Conducting t-tests to evaluate correlation based on various success criteria, such as median and quartile cuts for medal counts.

## Tools and Methods

The project was developed using **R**, applying descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing techniques. Separate analyses were conducted for the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, providing comprehensive insights.

## Conclusion

The research found a statistically significant correlation between average citizen height and Olympic success, suggesting that countries with taller populations may have a slight advantage in achieving greater success at the Olympic Games.
